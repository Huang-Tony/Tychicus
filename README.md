Tychicus is a hybrid Zero-Knowledge compliance framework designed to audit large-scale datasets (10GB+) on memory-constrained consumer hardware. By combining Rust-based streaming commitments with RISC Zero ZKVM and Starknet settlement contracts, it achieves high-speed data integrity verification without compromising privacy. The system demonstrates that big-data ZK-audits are viable on 8GB RAM systems, processing 10GB in under 30 seconds with immutable on-chain certification.
